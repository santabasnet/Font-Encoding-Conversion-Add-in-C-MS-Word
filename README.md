# Font-Encoding-Conversion-Add-in-C#-MS-Word

Devanagari script in the Nepali language is written using different encodings, including single-byte (TTF) and multi-byte (Unicode). As a result, various text formats exist. To enable further processing, text in different encodings needs to be converted into a unified format. This tool is designed to facilitate conversion between different Nepali Devanagari encodings.

This tool has been developed as an add-in for MS Word. It uses a remote REST API call to "https://hijje.com" for the conversion process. The document's formatting is maintained while converting the selected text's font and completely written in C# language.
